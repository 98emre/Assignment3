## Extra Assignment

### Problem 1: Person and Child Classes
You are asked to model an application for storing data about people. You should be able to have a person and a child. The child is derived from the person. Your task is to model the application. The only constraints are:
- People should not be able to have a negative age.
- Children should not be able to have an age greater than 15.

### Problem 2: Book and GoldenEditionBook Classes
You are working in a library and want to create classes to represent ordinary books and special ones. Your program should have two classes â€“ `Book` and `GoldenEditionBook`. A `GoldenEditionBook` is a special book that has the same properties as any book, but its price is always 30% higher.

### Problem 3: Human, Worker, and Student Classes
Your task is to model an application with three mandatory models: `Human`, `Worker`, and `Student`. Every student has a faculty number, and every worker has a weekly salary and work hours per day.

### Problem 4: Online Radio Database
Create an online radio station database that keeps information about all added songs. Design a custom exception hierarchy for invalid songs and ensure validation for artist name, song name, and song length.
